Ryan,

- Good job in creating your accounts!

- Good job in setting up your java compiler in your system.

- Good job with your first GitHub submission!

However,

- The repository is not organized as indicated in the handout, i.e., you were
  asked to organize your work and put your homework assignment in a folder
  named hw/0/ but you did not follow instructions.

- Please organize your GitHub repository immediately.

- Please staple all your assignments as necessary.



Peace,

- Dr. Pablo Rivas
